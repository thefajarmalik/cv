In order to succeed in this role, we hope you have good Finnish and English skills.

You’ll research novel use of cryptography to strengthen cybersecurity and privacy. The topic might be mathematical, (e.g. research of lattice-based cryptography) or technical (e.g. implementing or testing). 
You’ll verify the research results either by publishing and/or developing and evaluating a proof-of-concepts and cryptographic solutions. 
You’ll use your advanced skills in English to write research reports or blog that help the team communicate the research results clearly.
